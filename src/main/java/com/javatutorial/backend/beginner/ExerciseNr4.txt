This exercise is going to be different, because you will write no code at all. Instead I would like to introduce you
to Spring Boot Initializer available at https://start.spring.io/.
On this page you will find a code generator which will generate a zipped project structure with predefined dependencies
according to your choice. Once you download the code, you can uzip it and open in Intellij Idea (Always use option:
"Open as new project", when prompted. Also it is a good practice to store all your source code in folder /IdeaProjects
which is a default for Intellij Idea.
Exercise:
Generate a Maven project with source code based on newest stable version of Spring Boot, Java 11, main package
com.javatutorials.example and following dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA and H2 Database.
Download the zipped project, unzip it and move to /IdeaProject folder and open in Intellij Idea.
Spend some time with the code, try to start the application (SHIFT + F10). Try to execute maven goals: clean + install using IDE.
Look closely at generated maven file (points of attention:
1. version 0.0.1 which is the very first version ever, first major version of the app should be versioned as 1.0.0
2. parent section: spring-boot-starter-parent is parent dependencies in most Spring Boot projects
3. properties section: here you should put all your future dependencies' versions
4. dependency section: here you should put all your future dependencies

It's worth to mention that most of external dependencies is stored in Maven Repository (https://mvnrepository.com)
but it will happen, that you will use your own, your company's or other companies' repository, In this case you have
to configure such repository in pom file in specific section.
